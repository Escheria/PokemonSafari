Pokemon Safari
=============
A Pokemon game built as a Chrome Extension. Pokemon are encountered every few minutes, and can be battled and caught by selecting the extension icon when it changes to a "!". The passive nature of the game means that you never really devote any time to it, just seconds a day, but are constantly given little rewards and challenges, to make your web browsing a bit more fun. The formulas for battling and catching pokemon are the exact same as those used in the Safari Zone in original Pokemon games. 

Built using the Pokeapi by Paul Hallett.
